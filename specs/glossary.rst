   * - Term 
     - Definition/Description
   * - SHALL
     - This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "MUST", mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.[REF_3]
   * - SHOULD
     - This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.[REF_3]
   * - MAY
     - This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is trulyoptional. One vendor may choose to include the item because a particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels thatit enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item. An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the same vein an implementation which does include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the option provides.)[REF_3]

   * - QoS
     - Quality of Service
   * - Northbound Interface
     - In Computer Networking and Computer Architecture, a northboundinterface of a component is an interface that allows the component to communicate to a higher-level component, using the latter component's southbound interface
   * - Transpiler
     - Transpiling is a specific term for taking source code written in one language and transforming into another language that has a similar level of abstraction
   * - Quantum Machine
     - A human-made device whose collective operation follows the laws of quantum mechanics
   * - Adjacency Matrix
     - A square matrix normally used to represent a finite graph by defining adjacency of vertices as well as self-loops.
