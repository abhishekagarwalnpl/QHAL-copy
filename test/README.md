# Testing environment

The specifications defined in this repository are associated with a coding implementation of the most important aspects [code](lib/README.md).
The code itself is tested for correctness via a set of direct tests. 

To execute them:

```shell
  make tests
```

The testing framework leverages Docker-compose and has been tested on Linux and MacOs platforms. 
For more information on Docker compose: [docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
